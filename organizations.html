          <p>We give medical treatment to dogs, cats, equines, camels, monkey, birds and more from our hospital compound located in Jaipur Rajasthan. Established in 1980.
            The hospital and shelter was founded by Miss Crystal Rogers aided by Mr. G.K. Tiwari and (late) Dr. T. Ramchandani.
            The first shelter was located on land provided by H.H. Rajmata Gayatri Devi of Jaipur, but a chance meeting with Mme. Janine Vogler, of Animaux Secours in France proved to be the key moment in the charity’s growth. Trees were planted and that once barren plot is today a verdant, eco-friendly space.</p>
